# TicTacToe-Connect4
Connect 4 and TicTacToe made in Winforms and console

These were the first proper programs I made in WinForms and served as a useful learning experience for the jump to GUI from console. Making Connect 4 work was challenging enough, but by scaling up the logic used in a basic game of tictactoe, I was able to make it function not only for varying board sizes, but for Connect "n" in general. Whilst the interface (and flickering) may not be great, the programming behind these projects are still a great testament to how complex problems can be scaled down, broken up, and tackled with a logical mindset.
